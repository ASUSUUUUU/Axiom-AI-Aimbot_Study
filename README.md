## Overview

Axiom AI is a sophisticated computer vision application designed for real-time object detection and interaction. Built with Python and ONNX Runtime, it leverages DirectML for high-performance GPU acceleration to provide low-latency aim assistance. Featuring a modern Fluent Design UI with acrylic effects, multi-language support, and an intuitive setup wizard, Axiom makes advanced aim assistance accessible to everyone.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Aim Control**
  - PID controller with separate X/Y axis tuning for precise adjustments.
  - Bézier curve smoothing for natural, human-like mouse movement.
  - Customizable FOV and independent detection range.
  - Single-target mode for focusing on the nearest threat.
  - FOV follows mouse cursor for dynamic aiming.
  - Configurable head/body region ratios for fine-tuned targeting.

- **Smart Tracker (Prediction System)**
  - Velocity-based motion prediction for leading moving targets.
  - Adaptive smoothing with configurable prediction time.
  - Zero-lag reset on sudden direction changes or stops.
  - Visual prediction overlay for debugging and tuning.

- **Auto Fire (Triggerbot)**
  - Adjustable delay and fire intervals.
  - Target priority settings (Head / Body / Both).
  - Always-on mode or key-activated toggle.

- **High Performance**
  - ONNX Runtime with DirectML for GPU-accelerated inference.
  - DML ↔ CPU automatic fallback for maximum compatibility.
  - Low-latency capture and inference loop with configurable intervals.
  - Performance mode with optimized queue management.
  - Idle detection throttling to reduce resource usage when not aiming.

- **Multiple Input Methods**
  - `mouse_event` — Standard Windows API (default).
  - `ddxoft` — Third-party driver-level mouse simulation.
  - **Arduino Leonardo** — Hardware-based HID mouse via serial COM port.
  - **Xbox 360 Virtual Controller** — Gamepad emulation with adjustable sensitivity and deadzone.

- **Modern Fluent Design UI**
  - Built with PyQt6 + QFluentWidgets for a native Windows 11 look.
  - Acrylic (frosted glass) window effect with configurable transparency.
  - Dark / Light theme toggle.
  - First-run Setup Wizard for quick configuration.

- **Multi-Language Interface**
  - English, 中文, Français, Deutsch, हिन्दी, 日本語, 한국어, Português, Русский, Español.

   - On first launch, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through initial configuration (language, theme, model selection).

2. **Configure Settings**
   - **Aim Tab** — Select your game model, adjust FOV, detection range, and tune PID settings.
   - **Trigger Tab** — Configure auto-fire delay, interval, and target priority.
   - **Keys Tab** — Set your preferred hotkeys for toggling aim and auto-fire.
   - **Visuals Tab** — Customize overlays (FOV circle, bounding boxes, status panel).
   - **Configs Tab** — Save / load configuration presets.
   - **Other Tab** — Mouse method, Arduino, Xbox controller, performance, and advanced options.

3. **Start Detection**
   - Press the configured toggle key (default: `Insert`).
   - The system will begin real-time detection and overlay.

### Configuration Files

Settings are automatically saved to `config.json` in the project root. You can also save/load named presets via the **Configs** tab.
