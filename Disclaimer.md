## 1. Important Notice (Must Read)

1. This Software possesses capabilities for screen capture, image recognition/inference, overlay display, keyboard/mouse status monitoring, and input automation (mouse movement/clicks, virtual gamepad, etc.).

3. If you use this Software on platforms subject to terms, you may face account bans, suspension, data clearance, hardware bans (HWID bans), device blocking, account/asset loss, civil/criminal liability, and contractual liability.
4. The Provider does not encourage or authorize any behavior that violates laws or third-party terms; you must ensure that your usage is legal and compliant.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms (Agreement to be Bound)

1. By downloading, installing, launching, executing, or using this Software in any way, you indicate that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms.
2. If you do not agree to any part of these terms, please stop using and delete this Software and related files immediately.
3. If you are under the legal age of majority, you must use it under the consent and supervision of a legal guardian; otherwise, please do not use it.

## 3. Definitions

- "Third-Party Service": Any platform, game, website, API, anti-cheat system, account system, or its operator not operated by the Provider.
- "Input Automation": Any act of automatically or semi-automatically issuing keyboard/mouse/gamepad inputs (including simulated clicks, movements, rapid fire, macros, virtual gamepads, etc.).
- "Content": Includes model files, configuration files, language files, images, text, and any data processed or generated by this Software.

## 4. License and Restrictions

This Software is licensed under the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**.

1. **Non-Commercial Use**: You may not use this Software for any commercial purpose. Commercial purpose includes but is not limited to: exchanging money, goods, services, or other value, or as part of providing goods or services to others. Even if no fee is directly charged, it is considered commercial use if related to commercial activities.
2. **Personal Use**: Limited to personal, educational, or research purposes only.
3. **Rights Reserved**: The Provider reserves all rights not expressly granted.
4. **Termination of License**: If you use this Software for commercial purposes or violate any provision of these terms (including but not limited to the prohibited uses in Article 7), your license will terminate immediately.

## 5. Functionality and Risk Disclosure

You acknowledge and understand that this Software may contain or enable the following behaviors based on configuration (examples do not represent all):

1. Screen Capture/Image Processing: May capture full screen or regional images for recognition/inference; images may contain sensitive information.
2. Model Inference: Loads models such as ONNX and executes with GPU/DirectML or CPU; results may be incorrect, delayed, or unstable.
3. Overlay Display: Displays detection boxes, status, etc., via window overlay; some platforms/anti-cheats may view this as suspicious behavior.
4. Global Hotkey and Key/Mouse Monitoring: Monitors global keystrokes and mouse/keyboard status; may involve privacy and compatibility issues.
5. Input Injection/Simulation: Issues inputs via system APIs, virtual devices, or third-party components; may be restricted or prohibited.
6. System Privileges: Some functions may require administrator privileges; elevating privileges increases system risk (blocked by security software, false positives, or system instability).
7. Third-Party DLL/Drivers/Virtual Gamepads: If such components are enabled, you judge the security and legality yourself and bear the responsibility; may cause system instability or BSOD.

## 6. Obligations for Legal and Compliant Use

1. You will only use this Software in environments where you have the right and permission for automation/capture/overlay.
2. You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, and third-party service terms (including anti-cheat, no-bot, no-automation policies, etc.).
3. You will not use this Software for illegal purposes, infringing on others' rights, disrupting fairness, or causing damage to others.
4. You assess the usage risks yourself and are fully responsible for any consequences (bans/suspensions/losses).

## 7. Explicitly Prohibited Uses

It is prohibited to use this Software for or assist others in using it for:

1. Actions violating game/platform rules, anti-cheat policies, or terms of service.
2. Unfair competition, manipulating rankings, disrupting match fairness, or affecting others' normal use.
3. Evading detection, hiding behavior, countering, or bypassing security mechanisms.
4. Unauthorized access, monitoring, data collection, or privacy infringement.
5. Commercial sales, leasing, boosting/power-leveling services, or providing paid services (unless otherwise agreed in writing).
6. Any use that may cause damage to third parties or your own equipment/data.

## 8. Third-Party Services and Ban/Suspension Risks

1. The Provider is not affiliated with, nor endorsed, authorized, or recognized by any third-party service (including game companies/platforms/anti-cheat providers).
2. Even if this Software works, it does not mean it complies with third-party service terms; third parties may update detection, policies, or disposal methods at any time.
3. Using this Software may result in permanent bans, hardware bans (HWID bans), device blocking, asset loss, data deletion, and other irreversible consequences; you bear all risks yourself.

## 9. Privacy and Data Processing

1. This Software may process: screen pixels, detection box coordinates, confidence levels, timestamps, settings, key/mouse status, etc.
2. The Provider does not guarantee that sensitive information will not be captured; you should disable or close this Software yourself when sensitive screens are present.
3. Logs/debug outputs may contain errors and environment information; please de-identify yourself before sharing to avoid disclosing personal data and credentials.
4. This Software processes entirely on the local machine; without your explicit provision/enablement, the Provider will not actively transmit your screen images, detection content, key/mouse status, etc., to the outside.
5. If you actively report issues (e.g., providing error messages, logs, screenshots, or recordings), you confirm that you have the right to share such data and have masked sensitive information yourself; the Provider uses such data only for the purpose of handling your report.
6. You can stop using and delete related files of this Software at any time; if you have concerns about any data processing method, please stop using it.

1. This Software may have compatibility issues with OS security mechanisms, display/input drivers, display scaling, multi-monitors, recording/streaming software, and security software.
2. Elevating privileges, loading third-party DLLs/drivers, or using virtual devices may cause system instability, BSOD/crashes, input anomalies, data loss, or be blocked by security software.
3. If using low-level components (such as ddxoft related components), you should create restore points/backups yourself, verify in a test environment, and bear all risks yourself.
4. You should ensure sufficient equipment cooling and power supply, and understand that long-term inference may cause high load and impact hardware lifespan.
5. The Provider does not guarantee that this Software will operate normally under any hardware, Windows version, graphics card driver, or security/anti-cheat environment.
